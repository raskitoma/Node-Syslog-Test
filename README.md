# Simple syslog test (node.js)

Just a simple script that uses the `node-syslog` to send a syslog msg.

I've tested it against a graylog instance with success.

Use it as an example for your own scripts or projects.

Just install the package using:

```bash
npm i syslog
```

And run the test.js file:

```bash
node test.js
```
